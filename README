SimTower Clone (JavaScript/HTML5)
A modern, open-source recreation of the classic 1994 Maxis game SimTower (aka The Tower in Japan), built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and pure CSS — no frameworks, no engines.
Play it in any modern browser, build massive skyscrapers, manage residents, offices, hotels, elevators, and watch your tower come to life with simulated people, day/night cycles, and economic systems.

Current Status: Early playable prototype
Goal: Full faithful recreation of SimTower gameplay + modern improvements
Playable Features (as of January 2026)

Grid-based tower construction (40×50 floors)
Place: Offices, Condos, Hotels, Food Courts, Retail Shops, Cinemas, Parking, Stairs, Elevators, Lobbies, Sky Lobbies
Starting $2,000,000 budget with realistic build costs
Day/night cycle with time acceleration (Pause / Play / Fast)
Basic population simulation:
Office workers arrive in morning rush, go to work, leave in evening
People walk, wait for and ride elevators
Stress system (red dot when waiting too long)

Elevator system with:
Realistic door opening/closing
Multi-car shafts
Floor request queue with directional logic
Visual car movement and interior lighting

Income from offices, hotels, retail, food, cinema, parking
Classic Windows 95-style UI with beveled buttons, status bar, and toolbar
Pixel-perfect crisp rendering (image smoothing disabled)
Retro beep sounds on placement

Missing / Planned Features (Road to Full SimTower)
We have a solid foundation — now it's about adding depth and polish to reach the full SimTower experience.
High Priority (Core Gameplay)
[ ] Full resident simulation (condo/hotel guests with daily routines, happiness, moving in/out)
[ ] Proper population cap & tower rating system (1–5 stars → Tower status → final goal: 100 floors + Cathedral)
[ ] Stress & complaints system (overcrowding, noise, security, cleanliness affecting rent/income)
[ ] Security offices (reduce crime/terrorism events)
[ ] Housekeeping / Cleaning system (dirt accumulation, janitors)
[ ] Express elevators & Sky Lobbies fully functional (transfer floors)
[ ] Service elevators (separate from passenger)
[ ] Metro station & underground integration
[ ] Fire, terrorism, and disaster events
[ ] Recycling center & medical clinic effects
Medium Priority (Polish & Depth)
[ ] More room types: Fast Food, Deluxe Hotel Suites, Recycling, Medical, Cathedral
[ ] Better AI pathfinding (stairs as fallback, multiple elevator banks)
[ ] Elevator scheduling improvements (predictive stopping, rush hour logic)
[ ] Day/night lighting effects on windows
[ ] Animated people sprites (walking, different clothes)
[ ] Sound effects (elevator ding, crowd noise, construction)
[ ] Save/Load game state
[ ] Multiple tower scenarios / challenges
Low Priority (Nice to Have)
[ ] Zoom / pan controls
[ ] Modern UI toggle option
[ ] Mobile/touch support
[ ] Achievements / leaderboards
[ ] Mod support (custom sprites, rules)
